Splash Example Plugin

Some changes were made during a technical difficulty that resulted in the account associated with this plugin 
on the marketplace to remove the submitted project. These changes are more on the technical side although 
some further compatibility was ensured for 5.3 GameSDK project and end-user usage of the plugin was 
generally made easier.

# Usage differences
	1. The project now comes with two test projects that use GameZero/GameSDK as "Host" projects.
	2. Further documentation was added in 'Docs' folder.

# Technical changes
	*Some things may be missed, check github commits for more detailed information.
	
	1. The TestPlatform feature from the cmakelists file was defaulted to disabled to 
	    prevent unwanted folders being created when building from source.
