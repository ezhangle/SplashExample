Splash Example Plugin

# Compatiblity
	GameZero
	GameSDK
	Project templates

# Pre-requisites
	CRYENGINE version 5.3.x
	
    1. Compatible and working CRYENGINE installation either,
        by the official CRYENGINE Launcher, or 
        by building your own custom engine from source*
    
    2.  If using a project, that the project is working, and 
         both the Splash Example project and your own project
         uses the same CRYENGINE installation
		 
	3.  If building from source, the requirements match with 
	        the target engine version requirements, eg;
			Visual Studio 2015 + Win SDK 10586.

# Testing with GameZero or GameSDK
	1. Copy the 'GameZero/GameSDK' asset folder to the splash example project root
	
	2. Confirm the folder you copied is named correctly either, GameZero or GameSDK respectively.
	
	3. From the supplied 'Assets' directory, copy the 'SplashExample' folder to the GameSDK/GameZero assets folder you copied.
	    eg, for GameZero, you should now have a folder structure like so;
		   |----SplashExample
		       |----gamezero
		           |----levels
		           |----SplashExample
		           |----game.cfg
		           |----gamedata.cryasset.pak
		           |----...
	4. For best results, copy the contents of the supplied 'Assets/SplashExample.cfg' into your GameZero/GameSDK game.cfg file.
				   
	5. (Right-Click) Launch Game using one of the provided cryproject files 
		'SplashExamplePlugin_GameZero', or 'SplashExamplePlugin_GameSDK'
		
	Note: By default these projects are set to use the official engine 
	    supplied by the 'CRYENGINE Launcher' application.

# Installation/Integration into your project
	
	# Using pre-built binary for windows (x64 only)
		1. CE 5.3 makes use of cryplugin.csv file to load required plugins for the project,
		    you must make sure the line from the supplied file is added to the cryplugin.csv 
			responsible for your desired project.
		
		2. This package contains custom texture assets that must be bundled with your desired 
		    project assets, a simple 'drag & drop' from `Assets/SplashExample` to 
			to your `Project/Assets/SplashExample` will suffice.
		
		3. Due to compatiblity reasons with the player profiles manager certain CVARS should 
		    be set in either your system.cfg or game.cfg files in use by your project. To begin, 
			some example CVARS are provided in the `Assets/SplashExample.cfg` file.
		
		4. Make sure the binary (SplashExample.dll) is bundled with your own project binary, 
		    this should reside in `Project/bin/win_x64` directory next to any 'Game' dll.
		
	# Building Splash Example from source
		1. Please take a look at the supplied `Code/cmakelists.txt` file for variables that 
		    reference "TestPlatform". This is a feature tested with visual studio that allows 
			the output binary to be directly copied to a target project binary folder. Default 
			is disabled as the path will most certainly be innaccurate.
		
		2. If using a testplatform, the assets will still need to be copied to your projects assets.**
		
		3. As with other projects, simply use the 'SplashExamplePlugin.cryproject' file to generate 
		    the solution, and modify/build using Visual Studio.
    
			*   Of course, due to the nature of custom engine builds, support cannot be given 
						for custom built and modified engine installations. You take responsibility 
						to maintain compatiblity with your modifications and the plugin provided.
			
			**	This feature is experimental and may or may not be included with future iterations.
				
# WARNING
	It is not reccommended to use the "Switch engine version" feature of the cryproject context menu 
	for moving from or to different engine versions. Rather, only use this feature to swtich between 
	locally registered engines of the same version, ie, 'Official 5.3.x' and 'Custom Built-From-Source 5.3.x'.
